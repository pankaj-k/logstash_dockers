# Need to define in actions what is allowed to be done using the key. 
# The principal section is all about roles and users who can use the key. 
# In the section written it will end up in aws console as
# "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:user/iamadmin",
# "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/iot_trust_role",
# "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/ec2_assume_role"
# The resources are * so that the key can be used on all resources you want.

# session_mgr_access_role is added otherwise you cannot copy the certs from S3 buckets.
# This can be removed in production. This is for testing only. TODO: Remove it.

# LEARNING: you cannot assign aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role to the load balancer because AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) does not support IAM roles.
# IAM roles can be assigned to AWS services like ECS tasks, EC2 instances, or Lambda functionsâ€”but not to an ALB.
# ALBs use service principals (delivery.logs.amazonaws.com) to write logs to S3. These logs need to be encrypted using your KMS key.
# Since ALBs do not assume IAM roles, they must be granted access via a KMS key policy.
